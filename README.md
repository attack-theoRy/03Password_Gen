Javascript Password Generator

Technologies Used:
- Javascript
- HTML / CSS

Creates a random password between 8 and 128 characters long using criteria from the user including uppercase, lowercase, numbers and/or characters. Password will have at least one character from each criteria.  User is asked how long the password is and the program checks to see if they input a number between 8 and 128. Currently I don't have a way of error checking someone putting in a non-number, but it does put bounds on the length of the password. Password is output to the textbox.
